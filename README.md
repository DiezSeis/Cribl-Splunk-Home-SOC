# Home SOC Lab

Welcome to the **Home SOC Lab**! This project is a comprehensive setup aimed at creating a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment for home use. It leverages tools like Cribl, Splunk, and AWS S3 for log management, monitoring, and data storage.

## Project Overview

The Home SOC Lab is designed to emulate a production SOC environment and includes detailed configurations for syslog forwarding, event monitoring, and data ingestion from network devices and endpoints.

### Project Structure

The lab is organized into two parts:

- **Part 1**: Initial setup, including Cribl configuration, syslog forwarding, and log ingestion into AWS S3.
- **Part 2**: Expanding with advanced monitoring capabilities, integration with Splunk for log analysis, and ongoing optimizations for performance and data retention.

## Key Components

- **Cribl Stream and Edge** for data collection and routing.
- **Splunk** for data indexing and analysis.
- **AWS S3** for data storage.
- **Raspberry Pi and other devices** for log forwarding.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in `Part 1` for the initial setup.
3. Move to `Part 2` for advanced configurations and integrations.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional integrations with security tools.
- Further fine-tuning for real-world SOC scenarios.
